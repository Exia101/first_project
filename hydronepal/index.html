      <h1>Nepal</h1>
      <h2 id="nepal1">History:</h2>
        <p>The history of Nepal began in, and centres on, the Kathmandu Valley.
          Over the centuries Nepal's boundaries have extended to include huge
          tracts of neighbouring India, and contracted to little more than the
          Kathmandu Valley and a handful of nearby city-states. Though it has
          ancient roots, the modern state of Nepal emerged only in the 18th
          century.
          Squeezed between the Tibetan plateau and the plains of the s
          ubcontinent - the modern-day giants of China and India - Nepal has long
          prospered from its location as a resting place for traders, travellers
          and pilgrims. A cultural mixing pot, it has bridged cultures and
          absorbed elements of its neighbours, yet retained a unique character.
          After travelling through India for a while, many travellers notice both
          the similarities and differences. 'Same, same', they say, 'but different'.</p>
        <h3>Unification under the Shahs</h3>
          <p>It took more than a quarter of a century of conquest and consolidation,
          but by 1768 Prithvi Narayan Shah, ruler of the tiny hilltop kingdom of
          Gorkha (halfway between Pokhara and Kathmandu), stood poised on the edge
          of the Kathmandu Valley, about to realise his dream of a unified Nepal.
          Prithvi Narayan had taken the strategic hilltop fort of Nuwakot in 1744
          and had blockaded the valley, after fighting off reinforcements from
          the British East India Company. In 1768 Shah took Kathmandu, sneaking
          in while everyone was drunk during the Indra Jatra festival. A year
          later he took Kirtipur, finally, after three lengthy failed attempts.
          In terrible retribution his troops hacked 120 pounds of noses and lips
          off Kirtipur's residents; unsurprisingly, resistance throughout the
          valley quickly crumbled. In 1769 he advanced on the three Malla kings,
          who were quivering in Bhaktapur, ending the Malla rule and unifying Nepal.</p>
          <p>Shah moved his capital from Gorkha to Kathmandu, establishing the
          Shah dynasty, which rules to this day, with its roots in the Rajput
          kings of Chittor. Shah died just six years later in Nuwakot but is
          revered to this day as the founder of the nation. Shah had built his
          empire on conquest and his insatiable army needed ever more booty and
          land to keep it satisfied. Within six years the Gurkhas had conquered
          eastern Nepal and Sikkim. The expansion then turned westwards into
          Kumaon and Garhwal, only halted on the borders of the Punjab by the
          armies of the powerful one-eyed ruler Ranjit Singh. The kingdom's power
          continued to grow until a 1792 clash with the Chinese in Tibet led to
          an ignominious defeat, during which Chinese troops advanced down the
          Kyirong Valley to within 35km of Kathmandu. As part of the ensuing
          treaty the Nepalis had to cease their attacks on Tibet and pay tribute
          to the Chinese emperor in Beijing; the payments continued until 1912.</p>
          <p>The expanding Nepali boundaries, by this time stretching all the way
          from Kashmir to Sikkim, eventually put it on a collision course with
          the world's most powerful empire, the British Raj. Despite early treaties
          with the British, disputes over the Terai led to the first Anglo-Nepali
          war, which the British won after a two-year fight. The British were so
          impressed by their enemy that they decided to incorporate Gurkha
          mercenaries into their own army. The 1816 Sugauli treaty called a halt
          to Nepal's expansion and laid down its modern boundaries. Nepal lost
          Sikkim, Kumaon, Garhwal and much of the Terai, though some of this land
          was restored to Nepal in 1858 in return for support given to the British
          during the Indian Mutiny (Indian War of Independence). A British resident
          was sent to Kathmandu to keep an eye on things but the Raj knew that it
          would be too difficult to colonise the impossible hill terrain, preferring
          to keep Nepal as a buffer state. Nepalis to this day are proud that their
          country was never colonised by the British, unlike the neighbouring
          hill states of India. Following its humiliating defeat, Nepal cut itself
          off from all foreign contact from 1816 until 1951. The British residents
          in Kathmandu were the only Westerners to set eyes on Nepal for more than
          a century. On the cultural front, temple construction continued impressively,
          though perhaps of more import to ordinary people was the introduction,
          via India, of chillis, potatoes, tobacco and other New World crops. The
          Shah rulers, meanwhile, swung from ineffectual to seriously deranged.
          At one point the kingdom was governed by a twelve-year-old female regent,
          in charge of a nine-year-old king! One particularly sadistic ruler,
          Crown Prince Surendra, expanded the horizons of human suffering by
          ordering subjects to jump down wells or ride off cliffs, just to see
          whether they would die.</p>
        <h3 id="nepal2">Modern Nepal</h3>
          <p>In response to the 2006 democracy movement, King Gyanendra agreed to
          relinquish sovereign power to the people. On 24 April 2006 the dissolved
          House of Representatives was reinstated. Using its newly acquired
          sovereign authority, on 18 May 2006 the House of Representatives unanimously
          voted to curtail the power of the king and declared Nepal a secular state,
          ending its time-honoured official status as a Hindu Kingdom. On 28 December
          2007, a bill was passed in parliament to amend Article 159 of the
          constitution of replacing "Provisions regarding the King" by "Provisions
          of the Head of the State", declaring Nepal a federal republic, and
          thereby abolishing the monarchy. The bill came into force on 28 May 2008.</p>

      <h2>Hydropower Potential of Nepal:</h2>
        <p>Nepal has a huge hydropower potential. In fact, the perennial nature
          of Nepali rivers and the steep gradient of the country's topography
          provide ideal conditions for the development of some of the world's
          largest hydroelectric projects in Nepal. Current estimates are that
          Nepal has approximately 40,000 MW of economically feasible hydropower
          potential. However, the present situation is that Nepal has developed
          only approximately 600 MW of hydropower. Therefore, bulk of the economically
          feasible generation has not been realized yet. Besides, the multipurpose,
          secondary and tertiary benefits have not been realized from the development
          of its rivers. Although bestowed with tremendous hydropower resources,
          only about 40% of Nepal's population has access to electricity. Most of
          the power plants in Nepal are run-of-river type with energy available
          in excess of the in-country demand during the monsoon season and deficit
          during the dry season.</p>
        <p>Nepal's electricity generation is dominated by hydropower, though in
          the entire scenario of energy use of the country, the electricity is a
          tiny fraction, only 1% energy need is fulfilled by electricity. The bulk
          of the energy need is dominated by fuel wood (68%), agricultural waste
          (15%), animal dung (8%) and imported fossil fuel (8%). The other fact
          is that only about 40% of Nepal's population has access to electricity.
          With this scenario and having immense potential of hydropower development,
          it is important for Nepal to increase its energy dependency on electricity
          with hydropower development. This contributes to deforestation, soil
          erosion and depletion, and increased flooding downstream in the Ganges
          plain. Shortage of wood also pushes farmers to burn animal dung, which
          is needed for agriculture. Not only this, the development of hydropower
          will help to achieve the millennium development goals with protecting
          environment, increasing literacy, improving health of children and women
          with better energy. Growing environmental degradation adds a sense of urgency.</p>

      <h2>Benefits:</h2>
        <h3 id="ecobenefits1">Hydropower Advantages and Relavance</h3>
          <h4>Advantages of Hydro Power</h4>
            <p>There are several advantages associated with hydropower:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>non- polluting, clean and environment friendly energy</li>
                <li>renewable source of energy</li>
                <li>lower cost of generation, operation and maintenance than other
                    sources of energy</li>
                <li>ability to start and stop quickly</li>
                <li>immediate load acceptance/rejection makes it suitable to meet
                    peak demand, and for enhancing system reliability and stability</li>
                <li>cost of generation free from inflationary effects after the
                    initial installation</li>
                <li>low per unit cost in comparison to other forms of energy</li>
                <li>most feasible form of energy for carbon credits</li>
                <li>storage based hydro schemes provide benefits of flood control,
                    irrigation, drinking water supply, navigation, recreation,
                    tourism and aquaculture, and opening of avenues for development
                    of remote and backward areas</li>
              </ul>
          <h4>Relavance of Hydro Power for Nepal</h4>
            <p>For Nepal, hydropower is the best energy alternative for the
               following reasons:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>puts minimum strain on resources</li>
                <li>water being abundant domestic resource, minimizes foreign
                    dependency on energy</li>
                <li>Nepal can derive and harness all the associated benefits</li>
                <li>can serve as the backbone for the overall socio-economic development</li>
                <li>significant export potential and thus huge opportunity to
                    balance its present trade imbalances</li>
                <li>real possibility to earn huge sums of foreign exchange as
                    secondary benefits in terms of carbon credit</li>
              </ul>
        <h3 id="ecobenefits2">Carbon Alternative</h3>
          <p>There is a little doubt that hydroelectricity is cleaner, in terms
             of carbon release, than the other sources of energy
             such as fossil fuels or biomass-based fuels. We have
             carried out a simple calculation to determine the amount
             of carbon being prevented from release by current hydroelectric
             plants in Nepal.</p>

      <h2>Issues and Barriers:</h2>
        <p>Inconsistency at the policy level is widely criticized by hydropower
           sector professionals and is blamed for the slow pace of hydropower development.
           A consultation workshop held at SchEMS, Pokhara University, on 17
           September 2012 for hydropower developers, user groups, experts as well
           as government authorities identified how initial hydropower-friendly
           government policies, introduced in the early 1990s, were later revised
           (repeatedly), ruining the investment environment for hydropower in
           Nepal. As a result, stakeholders (particularly potential investors)
           are now unsure what approach to take.</p>
